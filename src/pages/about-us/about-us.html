                <p>
                    I’m so excited to lead a school that is a great community institution and a world-class high school in Midlands. I’ve already
                    heard from so many parents, students, ministers and community leaders about how excited they are – and
                    we’re going to tap into that excitement. We are creating a new Dyett High School, which will be an open
                    enrollment, neighborhood school that is arts focused and has a technology lab and training center. The
                    school will open for the 2018-19 school year and have 550 students when it is fully enrolled.
                    <br>
                    <br> The new school concept was celebrated by a broad coalition of community groups, clergy, and elected
                    officials representing Bronzeville and the larger south side community, and it will incorporate key themes
                    identified by the RFP process, such as a technology hub for the larger community, and the need for fine
                    arts programming that are consistent with the legacy of the school's namesake, Walter H. Dyett.
                    <br>
                    <br> CPS worked with multiple community partners to arrive at a solution that meets several needs: create
                    an open enrollment neighborhood high school, fill the critical demand for an arts high school on the
                    south side, produce an enrollment stream that can weather population changes, and work with education
                    leaders to create a technology hub.
                    <br>
                    <br> With the Selective Enrollment process underway, you can expect to see us out in the community, talking
                    to students in the neighborhood, at the feeder schools and who have an interest in the arts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br> I also look forward to working with the leaders on our Technical Advisory Committees, who are recognized
                    leaders in their fields, so that that they can provide insight and guidance on what our needs will be.
                    <br>
                    <br> I will also be holding monthly community meetings so if you have questions or feedback, you can talk
                    with me then, or you can reach out separately and email me at bamcloyd@cps.edu.
                    <br>
                    <br> And in the coming months, I’ll be hiring staff for the school. I’ve already heard from a number of educators
                    who are excited and want to be a part of this school. I’ll be looking for teachers who are committed
                    to rigor, taking our students to the next level and passionate about engaging children.

                                    in his father’s profession of stonemasonry, an occupation that opened the doors for him
                                    to travel and work in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In South Africa John arrived

                                <p>It is said that Sherriff wrote enthusiastically to friends in Great Britain, Australia and
                                    New Zealand about the missionary prospects in the area and in 1901 made a trip home to
                                    the two latter nations; by his first hand account gained additional support. The Foreign
                                    Missions Committee of New Zealand gave Sherriff money to erect a small brick building
                                    that was used for a church and a school. Though in the initial phase of the work John
                                    Sherriff faced several challenges he estimated that by 1904 he had baptized two whites,
                                    six African women and 67 African men and youths.</p>

                                <p>Sensing the great possibilities to be found in Rhodesia the New Zealand Committee agreed
                                    the following year to take full financial responsibility for the work in the Bulawayo
                                    area and sent Mr. And Mrs. Frank Leslie Hadfield to join Sherriff. There were church
                                    services for blacks and whites, a Sunday school, a day school and night classes. By 1907
                                    an outstation was begun at Intini, seven kilometers from town with practical training
                                    classes for Africans as well as teacher and preacher training. At Forrest Vale, eight
                                    kilometers from the town, a 412-acre farm was purchased and an agricultural school was
                                    commenced. Shortly thereafter Thomas Anderson emigrated from Scotland to assist in the
                                    new work. The next New Zealanders to arrive were Mr. and Mrs. William (Wally) Mansill
                                    who came a few years after the Hadfields. By this time the work was ever expanding in

                                <p> By 1911 the government approached the Bulawayo Church of Christ leaders about opening a new
                                    outstation 200 kilometers to the east in the Belingwe area (now called the Lundi Reserve).
                                    With permission and support from the New Zealand churches Frank Hadfield, Wally Mansill
                                    and six African helpers set off in 1912 to begin a new station at Ingome. There they
                                    began the very first school in Lundi, with twenty young people, in January of 1913. Subsequently,
                                    a new school was opened almost every year, including one at Old Dadaya. The progress
                                    was not without its costs; in March of 1913 Wally Mansill suffered a fatal sunstroke
                                    leaving a wife and unborn child. A severe drought and the commencement of the Great War
                                    in 1914 brought additional strains to the Mission, the health of the missionaries was
                                    often compromised but still the Lord gave increase to the work.</p>

                                    73 others awaiting baptism. Vonna Phillips soon married Douglas Hadfield, elder son of

                                    270 km from Dadaya, this was the last native population group yet untouched by missionary
                                    influence. The estimated population was about 6300 most of who had never seen a white
                                    person. Under the guidance of Alf Bowen nine schools and churches were commenced at Mashoko,
                                    which means “The Word(s) or The Message (the Gospel).” As the area and the outstation

                                    for nearly three decades until it was transferred to the care of American missionaries
                                    of the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ in 1956. More on this transfer later.
