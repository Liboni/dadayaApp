                    <p>The story of the Stone-Campbell Movement in Zimbabwe begins with John Sherriff, the son of
                        an English stonemason, born in Christchurch, New Zealand in 1864. Young John followed
                        in his father’s profession of stonemasonry, an occupation that opened the doors for him
                        to travel and work in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. In South Africa John arrived
                        at Cape Town in February of 1896 went briefly to Johannesburg, and later settled for
                        a time in Pretoria employing his skills in the building of the law Court’s and Kruger’s
                        Church. While he fell in love with Pretoria he came to feel that this was still not the
                        place for his life’s work and made plans to move further north into Rhodesia, beyond
                        the Limpopo, to Bulawayo, a town just being opened up for early settlement.</p>

                    <p>Sherriff and his traveling companions arrived in Bulawayo in the last hours of 1897. On the
                        second of January 1898 John Sherriff gathered together a few Europeans friends and spread
                        before them the Lord’s Supper. Thus was the beginning of Stone-Campbell Movement in Rhodesia.</p>

                    <p>John Sherriff began working as a stonemason during the day and at night soon found the opportunity
                        to commence a night school for some African boys, meeting twice a week from 7-9 pm in
                        his own small room. English was his subject the Bible was his textbook.</p>

                    <p>It is said that Sherriff wrote enthusiastically to friends in Great Britain, Australia and
                        New Zealand about the missionary prospects in the area and in 1901 made a trip home to
                        the two latter nations; by his first hand account gained additional support. The Foreign
                        Missions Committee of New Zealand gave Sherriff money to erect a small brick building
                        that was used for a church and a school. Though in the initial phase of the work John
                        Sherriff faced several challenges he estimated that by 1904 he had baptized two whites,
                        six African women and 67 African men and youths.</p>

                    <p>Sensing the great possibilities to be found in Rhodesia the New Zealand Committee agreed
                        the following year to take full financial responsibility for the work in the Bulawayo
                        area and sent Mr. And Mrs. Frank Leslie Hadfield to join Sherriff. There were church
                        services for blacks and whites, a Sunday school, a day school and night classes. By 1907
                        an outstation was begun at Intini, seven kilometers from town with practical training
                        classes for Africans as well as teacher and preacher training. At Forrest Vale, eight
                        kilometers from the town, a 412-acre farm was purchased and an agricultural school was
                        commenced. Shortly thereafter Thomas Anderson emigrated from Scotland to assist in the
                        new work. The next New Zealanders to arrive were Mr. and Mrs. William (Wally) Mansill
                        who came a few years after the Hadfields. By this time the work was ever expanding in
                        Bulawayo and beyond.</p>

                    <p> By 1911 the government approached the Bulawayo Church of Christ leaders about opening a new
                        outstation 200 kilometers to the east in the Belingwe area (now called the Lundi Reserve).
                        With permission and support from the New Zealand churches Frank Hadfield, Wally Mansill
                        and six African helpers set off in 1912 to begin a new station at Ingome. There they
                        began the very first school in Lundi, with twenty young people, in January of 1913. Subsequently,
                        a new school was opened almost every year, including one at Old Dadaya. The progress
                        was not without its costs; in March of 1913 Wally Mansill suffered a fatal sunstroke
                        leaving a wife and unborn child. A severe drought and the commencement of the Great War
                        in 1914 brought additional strains to the Mission, the health of the missionaries was
                        often compromised but still the Lord gave increase to the work.</p>

                        strong to be entrusted to native leadership with Mr. Hadfield in an honorary supervisory
                        position. Mr. Frederick John Phillips arrived from the Nelson (New Zealand) Church of
                        Christ for a one-year term. Tom Anderson died as a result of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic
                        and J.W. Classen came up from the Cape Town churches to assist in the work. </p>

                        reorganized the station, erected a new building and soon began to breathe new life into
                        the mission. There were at that time approximately 130 members in the local church with

                        270 km from Dadaya, this was the last native population group yet untouched by missionary
                        influence. The estimated population was about 6300 most of who had never seen a white
                        person. Under the guidance of Alf Bowen nine schools and churches were commenced at Mashoko,
                        which means “The Word(s) or The Message (the Gospel).” As the area and the outstation
                        grew additional schools were added. Dadaya missionaries supervised this distant outpost
                        for nearly three decades until it was transferred to the care of American missionaries
                        of the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ in 1956. More on this transfer later.
